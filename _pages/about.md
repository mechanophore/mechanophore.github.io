Hi there! I’m a PhD candidate in the Chemistry department at Stanford University. My advisor is [Yan Xia](https://xialab.stanford.edu/). My research explores the influence of forces on chemical reactivity in polymer chains. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kIddhX4AAAAJ&hl=en).

During graduate school, I’ve used organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, polymer characterization, and computational chemistry to develop new polymers that contain mechanophores, subject them to force, and describe the chemistry of the resulting transformations. This work started by developing more scalable and modular approaches to synthesizing mechanophores based on fused cyclobutane motifs. By directly polymerizing cyclobutene-containing mechanophore monomers, we can create polymechanophores containing very high fractions of force-cleavable bonds. This results in dramatic changes in material properties before and after sonication, and we are working to translate this to changes in the mechanical properties of bulk materials. Using single molecule force spectroscopy to quantify the force required for mechanoactivation of several different ladderane-family derivatives, we found that the stereoelectronics at the first bond broken determine the force necessary for these ring opening reactions. 

Prior to graduate school, I studied chemistry at Duke University. I worked on developing metallopolymers which would undergo ligand sphere reconfiguration upon applied force, under the guidance of [Katherine Franz](https://sites.duke.edu/franzlab/) and [Stephen Craig](https://craiglab.chem.duke.edu/).

Outside the lab, I enjoy gardening and vegetarian cooking. I believe that thinking systematically and scientifically about the societal and material forces that led to our current world is essential to understanding it and successfully working to improve it, which leads me to value reading broadly, critically, and in dialogue with others.
