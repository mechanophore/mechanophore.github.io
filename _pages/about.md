Hi there! Iâ€™m an postdoctoral researcher in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry department at the University of California San Francisco, where I will work with [William DeGrado](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/degrado). My research uses _de novo_ protein design to explore foundational principles in mechanotransduction and macromolecular chemistry. You can find a list of my past publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kIddhX4AAAAJ&hl=en).

During my doctoral research, I studied how mechanical forces influence chemical reactivity in macromolecules. Working with [Yan Xia](https://xialab.stanford.edu/), I  applied organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, materials characterization, and computational techniques to develop novel polymers with force-responsive motifs (mechanophores). This research helped establish design principles linking molecular structure, polymer properties, and force-coupled reaction mechanisms that will advance the development of new mechanophores.

I studied chemistry as an undergraduate at Duke University, where I researched force-responsive metallopolymers under the guidance of [Katherine Franz](https://sites.duke.edu/franzlab/) and [Stephen Craig](https://craiglab.chem.duke.edu/).

Outside the lab, I enjoy birdwatching, gardening, and vegetarian cooking. I believe that a scientific understanding of the societal and material forces that have shaped our world is crucial to successfully working to improve it: this leads me to value reading broadly, critically, and in dialogue with others.
