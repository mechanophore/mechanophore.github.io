Hi there! I’m a PhD candidate in the Chemistry department at Stanford University. My advisor is [Yan Xia](https://xialab.stanford.edu/). My research explores the influence of forces on chemical reactivity in polymer chains. You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kIddhX4AAAAJ&hl=en).

During graduate school, I’ve used organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, polymer characterization, and computational chemistry to develop new polymers that contain mechanophores, subject them to force, and describe the chemistry of the resulting transformations. We have developed more scalable and modular approaches to synthesizing mechanophores with fused cyclobutane motifs. Ring opening metathesis polymerization of fused cyclobutene-containing mechanophore monomers allows us to create narrow-disperse, high molecular weight polymechanophores with very high fractions of force-cleavable bonds. Sonication of these polymers results in dramatic changes in material properties, and we are working to translate these polymer designs to yield force-induced dramatic changes in the material properties of bulk polymers. Using single molecule force spectroscopy to quantify the force required for mechanoactivation of several different ladderane-family derivatives, we found that the stereoelectronics at the first bond broken determine the force necessary for these ring opening reactions. We have shown that the ring opening of pterodactylane occurs at much lower forces than that of its regioisomer, 4-ladderane, and we have discovered both force-accelerated and force-suppressed elementary steps in its transformation. By understanding the relationship between molecular structure, polymer properties, and mechanochemistry, we can discover design principles for new macromolecules.

Prior to graduate school, I studied chemistry at Duke University. I worked on developing metallopolymers which would undergo ligand sphere reconfiguration upon applied force, under the guidance of [Katherine Franz](https://sites.duke.edu/franzlab/) and [Stephen Craig](https://craiglab.chem.duke.edu/).

Outside the lab, I enjoy gardening and vegetarian cooking. I believe that thinking systematically and scientifically about the societal and material forces that led to our current world is essential to understanding it and successfully working to improve it, which leads me to value reading broadly, critically, and in dialogue with others.
