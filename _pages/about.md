Hi there! Iâ€™m an incoming postdoctoral researcher in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry department at the University of California San Francisco, where I will work with [William DeGrado](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/william.degrado). My research will use foundational principles in biological and macromolecular chemistry to guide computational protein design. You can find a list of my past publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kIddhX4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My doctoral work explored the influence of forces on chemical reactivity in macromolecules. Working with [Yan Xia](https://xialab.stanford.edu/), I  used organic synthesis, polymer chemistry, materials characterization, and computational chemistry to develop new polymers that contain force-responsive motifs (mechanophores) and to describe the chemistry of their transformations. By resolving relationships between molecular structure, polymer properties, and mechanochemistry, I contributed to the development of design principles for new mechanophores.

I previously studied chemistry at Duke University and worked to develop force-responsive metallopolymers under the guidance of [Katherine Franz](https://sites.duke.edu/franzlab/) and [Stephen Craig](https://craiglab.chem.duke.edu/).

Outside the lab, I enjoy gardening, vegetarian cooking, and birdwatching. I believe that thinking systematically and scientifically about the societal and material forces that led to our current world is essential to understanding it and successfully working to improve it, which leads me to value reading broadly, critically, and in dialogue with others.
